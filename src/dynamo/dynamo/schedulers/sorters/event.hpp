  /*! \brief A generic event type, which the more specialised events
      are converted to before they are sorted.

      This conversion is lossy, so events need to be recalculated if
      they are to be exectuted. 

      The RECALCULATE event type is special. If any IntEvent, GlobalEvent
      or LocalEvent has a type RECALCULATE, it is carried through. RECALCULATE
      events cause the system to be moved forward in time and the
      events for the particle are recalculated. This can all be
      handled by the scheduler.
